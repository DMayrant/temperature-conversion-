Most counties depend on the metric system to meassure temperature, degrees Celsius C˚ is used. The United States is one of the only counties that use the imperial system 
to measure temperature in degrees Fahrenheit F˚. To take more a scientific approach weather is measured in Kelvin K with 0 kelvin (absolute zero) being the
lowwest temperature possible. This python project demonstrates coversions from F˚, C˚ and K to help you with the conversion depending on if your country uses 
the metric system or the imperial system
